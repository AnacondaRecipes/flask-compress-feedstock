  summary: Flask-Compress allows you to easily compress your Flask application's responses with gzip, deflate, brotli or zstd.
  description: |
    Flask-Compress allows you to easily compress your Flask application's responses with gzip, deflate, brotli or zstd. 
    It originally started as a fork of Flask-gzip. Supported Python versions are 3.9 and newer.
    The preferred solution is to have a server (like Nginx) automatically compress the static files for you. 
    If you don't have that option Flask-Compress will solve the problem for you.
